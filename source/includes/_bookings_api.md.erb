# Bookings API

Allow to your customers reserve a attention schedule for a better experience reducing the waiting time and improve the congestion of your branches. The endpoints of this section allow the creation of bookings from your application.

<% current_page.data.bookings_api && current_page.data.bookings_api.each do |resource| %>
  <%= partial "includes/bookings_api/#{resource}" %>
<% end %>
